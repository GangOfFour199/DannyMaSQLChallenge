-- Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

-- customer 1 was saitisifed with trial and purchased monthly sub straight after
-- customer 2 did similar, however selected annual subscription
-- 3 followed customer 1's plan
-- 4 purchased monthly after trial, however cancelled 3 months in
-- customer 5 and 8 also happy with trial period and purchased basic monthly
-- customer 6 however cancelled their monthly sub 2 months along
-- customer 7 purchased pro monthly after basic, looking to benefit from more features which would prove good value to them
-- customer 8 felt basic monthly lacked the advantages worthwhile to them, so followed 7's lead and bought pro monthly

-- OVERALL TRENDS => trial tends to prove a big success, many cutsomers here happy with what's on offer and went straight to subscriptions. Customers are incentivised to buy pro subs to gain even more benefits for their leisure.

-- 2 cancellations out of 8 is not a poor rate at all, obviously we need to look at a larger sample size to get a more representative % of cancellations
