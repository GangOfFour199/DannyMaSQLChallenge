Which interests have been present in all month_year dates in our dataset?

SELECT mp.interest_name, COUNT(met.month_year) AS present_mths 
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics met
JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map mp
ON met.interest_id::INT = mp.id
WHERE met._month IS NOT NULL
AND met._year IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(met.month_year) >= (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics)
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

/*
interest_name	present_mths

Using this same total_months measure - calculate the cumulative percentage of all records starting at 14 months - which total_months value passes the 90% cumulative percentage value?
If we were to remove all interest_id values which are lower than the total_months value we found in the previous question - how many total data points would we be removing?
Does this decision make sense to remove these data points from a business perspective? Use an example where there are all 14 months present to a removed interest example for your arguments - think about what it means to have less months present from a segment perspective.
After removing these interests - how many unique interests are there for each month?
