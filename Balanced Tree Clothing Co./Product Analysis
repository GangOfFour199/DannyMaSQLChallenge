What is the total transaction “penetration” for each product? (hint: penetration = number of transactions where at least 1 quantity of a product was purchased divided by total number of transactions)

-- Our results show that out of the entirety of transactions that occured, item variance was pretty minimal and each product was included in roughly 50% of all transactions

What is the most common combination of at least 1 quantity of any 3 products in a 1 single transaction?

-- Define a combination count which inlcudes 3 products in 1 single transaction
-- Determine the frequency of these combination counts to find the most common trio
-- Join sales table on itself 2 times, in order to have 3 tables to join together
-- Include conditional AND clause, where product_id is either less than subsequent tables prod_id, as then the combinations will be of 3 unique prod_id
-- Count the combinations of these products 
-- Limit it to 1 to find most common combination
