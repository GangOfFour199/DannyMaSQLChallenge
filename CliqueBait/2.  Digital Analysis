How many users are there?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM clique_bait.users; 
-- 500 users

How many cookies does each user have on average?

SELECT AVG(sub.cookie_count) AS avg_cookies
FROM (
SELECT user_id, COUNT(cookie_id) AS cookie_count

GROUP BY 1) sub;
-- On average, each user has 3.564 cookies.

What is the unique number of visits by all users per month?

What is the number of events for each event type?

SELECT ev.event_type, evid.event_name, COUNT(ev.event_type) AS num_events
FROM clique_bait.events ev
JOIN clique_bait.event_identifier evid
ON ev.event_type = evid.event_type
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1;

What is the percentage of visits which have a purchase event?

Join the events and events_identifier table and filter by Purchase event only.
As the data is now filtered to having Purchase events only, counting the distinct visit IDs would give you the number of purchase events.
Then, divide the number of purchase events with a subquery of total number of distinct visits from the events table.

SELECT ei.event_name, COUNT(ei.event_type) AS num_purchases, CAST(100 * CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT ev.visit_id) AS FLOAT) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT visit_id) FROM clique_bait.events) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS purchase_pct
FROM clique_bait.events ev
JOIN clique_bait.event_identifier ei
ON ev.event_type = ei.event_type
WHERE ei.event_name = 'Purchase'
GROUP BY 1;

-- Purchase	1777 purchases	49.86% of visits

/* IMPORTANT! => must convert distinct purchase visit_id's as a float in order to calculate a decimal pct at the end */

What is the percentage of visits which view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event?

Part 1: Create a CTE and using CASE statements, find the SUM() of:
page_name = 'Checkout' (Checkout), and assign "1" to these events. These events are when user viewed the checkout page.
event_name ='Purchase' and assign "1" to these events. These events signifies users who made a purchase.

WITH customer_decision_cte AS (
  SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN ph.page_name = 'Checkout' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS checkout_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN ei.event_name = 'Purchase' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase_count
  FROM clique_bait.events ev
  JOIN clique_bait.event_identifier ei
  ON ev.event_type = ei.event_type
  JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy ph
  ON ev.page_id = ph.page_id
  WHERE ph.page_name = 'Checkout' OR ei.event_name = 'Purchase'
)

Part 2: Using the table we have created, find the percentage of visits which view checkout page.

SELECT checkout_count, purchase_count, CAST(100 * (checkout_count - purchase_count)/ CAST(checkout_count AS FLOAT) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS checkout_no_purchase_pct
FROM customer_decision_cte;

-- MAKE SURE TO CONVERT FINAL % VALUE TO DECIMAL, CONVERT THE DIVISOR TOTAL TO A FLOAT!!!! 

/* 
   checkout_count	purchase_count	checkout_no_purchase_pct
   2103	                1777	         15.50
*/

What are the top 3 pages by number of views?

What is the number of views and cart adds for each product category?
