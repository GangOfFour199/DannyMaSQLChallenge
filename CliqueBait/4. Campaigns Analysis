Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record and has the following columns:

user_id
visit_id
visit_start_time: the earliest event_time for each visit
page_views: count of page views for each visit
cart_adds: count of product cart add events for each visit
purchase: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
campaign_name: map the visit to a campaign if the visit_start_time falls between the start_date and end_date
impression: count of ad impressions for each visit
click: count of ad clicks for each visit

/****************** STEPS ******************/

We will merge multiple tables:
Using JOIN for users and events table
joining event_identifier table using LEFT JOIN to filter the event_name in SELECT
Joining campaign_identifier table using LEFT JOIN as we want all lines that have event_time between start_date and end_date.
Joining page_hierachy table using LEFT JOIN as we want all the rows in the page_hierachy table
To generate earliest visit_start_time for each unique visit_id, use MIN() to find the 1st visit_time.
Wrap SUM() with CASE statement in order to find the total number of counts for page_views, cart_adds, purchase, ad impression and ad click.

To get a list of products added into cart sorted by sequence:
1. Firstly, use a CASE statement to only get cart add events.
2. Then, use STRING_AGG() to separate products by comma , and sort the sequence using `sequence_number WITHIN GROUP

-- FEEDBACK

-- Oysters remain highly popuular purchases, irrespective of campaign. Constantly in top 3 products.
-- With more generous discounting, consumers are enticed to purchase more luxurious products i.e lobster & crab sales top when 50% off.
-- When there is a buy one get one free offer, consumers graviate towards purchasing fish as opposed to shellfish. Perceived to get a lot more value for money, fish have a lot more sustanance so having 2 quantities for the price of one is considered very good value.
-- Each campaign slogan could suggest subconscious leanings to consumer behaviour. 'Fishing for Compliments' campaign experienced only instance where all 3 fish (salmon, tuna, kingfish) were in top product purchases.
-- Meanwhile, 'Treat your Shellfish' saw its top 3 sales comprising of shellfish products
