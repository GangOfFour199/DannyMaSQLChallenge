This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and want to inspect the impact before and after a certain point in time.

Taking the week_date value of 2020-06-15 as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect.

We would include all week_date values for 2020-06-15 as the start of the period after the change and the previous week_date values would be before

Using this analysis approach - answer the following questions:

What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?

-- declare the 4 weeks before and after cte's
-- total sales together in sums cte that groups sales by which 4 week period they fall into
-- eventually, select all columns of dat from summations cte to calculate sales variance and % variance

WITH four_weeks_before AS (
SELECT DISTINCT formatted_date 
FROM data_mart.clean_weekly_sales
WHERE formatted_date BETWEEN (TO_DATE('2020-06-15', 'yy-mm-dd') - INTERVAL '4 weeks') AND (TO_DATE('2020-06-15', 'yy-mm-dd') - INTERVAL '1 week')

FROM data_mart.clean_weekly_sales
)

SELECT *, (sales_weeks_after - sales_weeks_before) AS sales_variance,
-- Don't forget to convert to numeric value in order to round properly!
ROUND(100*(sales_weeks_after - sales_weeks_before)::NUMERIC / sales_weeks_before , 2) AS pct_growth
FROM summations;

-- The verdict is since the introduction of sustainable packagaing, the sales have decreased by 1.15%.

What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?

-- modify 4 week period to 12 week periods, the structure of the operation remains the same

WITH twelve_weeks_before AS (
SELECT DISTINCT formatted_date 
FROM data_mart.clean_weekly_sales
WHERE formatted_date BETWEEN (TO_DATE('2020-06-15', 'yy-mm-dd') - INTERVAL '12 weeks') AND (TO_DATE('2020-06-15', 'yy-mm-dd') - INTERVAL '1 week')

-- Don't forget to convert to numeric value in order to round properly!
ROUND(100*(sales_weeks_after - sales_weeks_before)::NUMERIC / sales_weeks_before , 2) AS pct_growth
FROM summations;

-- With a lengthier time frame considered, there is a pertinent question to be asked as to how the introduction of sustainable packaging has coincided with negative business growth.

-- It would be beneficial for the company to conduct a survery or retrieve as much customer feedback possible to determine what has changed in consumer perception of the company and their thoughts on the change to a new packaging design.

How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?

-- To compare with previous years, we declare a target date cte
-- We use cte's for 4 weeks before & after, then for 12 weeks

-- For a 12 week period, the company enjoyed impressive growth in 2018, the year following the growth of sales stabilised and is now facing a downtrend of 2.14%.
-- After carrying out further analyses, it does highlight that sustainable packaging of products has proven disadvantageous for business growth
