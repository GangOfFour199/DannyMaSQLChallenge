What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?

SELECT txn_type, COUNT(*) AS number_transactions, 
SUM(txn_amount) AS total_transaction_amount
FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
GROUP BY 1;

-- purchase -> 1617 -> $806537
-- deposit -> 2671 -> $1359168
-- withdrawal -> 1580 -> $793003

What is the average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?

AS a common table expression:

WITH customerDeposits AS (
SELECT customer_id, txn_type, COUNT(*) AS number_transactions, 
SUM(txn_amount) AS total_transaction_amount
FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
WHERE txn_type = 'deposit'
GROUP BY 1, 2
)

SELECT AVG(number_transactions), AVG(total_transaction_amount)
FROM customerDeposits;

-- AS a subquery:

SELECT AVG(sub.number_transactions) AS avg_deposit_counts, AVG(sub.total_transaction_amount) AS avg_deposit_amounts
FROM (
SELECT customer_id, txn_type, COUNT(*) AS number_transactions, 
SUM(txn_amount) AS total_transaction_amount
FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
WHERE txn_type = 'deposit'
GROUP BY 1, 2
) sub;

-- avg deposit counts 5
-- avg depsoit amount 2718.34

For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase or 1 withdrawal in a single month?

WITH monthlyCustomerActions AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    EXTRACT('month' FROM txn_date) AS months,
    SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS deposit_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'purchase' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN txn_type = 'withdrawal' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS withdrawal_count
  FROM data_bank.customer_transactions
  GROUP BY 1, 2
)

SELECT 
  months,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM monthlyCustomerActions
WHERE deposit_count > 1
  AND (purchase_count = 1 OR withdrawal_count = 1)
GROUP BY 1;

/* 
month 1 = 115 customers
month 2 = 108
month 3 - 113
month 4 = 50
*/

What is the closing balance for each customer at the end of the month?

-- Create a CTE monthly_transaction to find the SUM of all transactions in every month for each customer.

What is the percentage of customers who increase their closing balance by more than 5%?

next_balance AS (

-- answer is 75.8% of customers' clsoing balance increased by 5% from previous month.
